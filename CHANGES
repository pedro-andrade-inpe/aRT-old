LABELS:
  * is a structural change
  + is a new feature
  - is a bug fix
  . is a minor change

VERSION 1.9-2
  - bug with in addRaster() with generated wrong borders of the raster in the database

VERSION 1.9-1
  - createAndFillColumn was not working properly with raster data (problem with default and dummy)
  . createAndFillColumn does not require raster anymore when the target is a raster layer 

VERSION 1.9-0
  + GPM bugs were fixed
  . GPM now can use different functions to compute distances between points

VERSIOM 1.8-2
  . open networks can be weighted by attributes of their lines

VERSION 1.8-1
  + functions saveGPM, saveGAL, and saveGWT
  - getRelation returned an error when the result is empty, now it returns NULL
  + createAndFillColumn can use dummy and default values for raster strategies
  + now working with terralib 4.2.0

VERSION 1.8-0
  + now working with terralib 4.0.0
  + can now work with any database version from 4.4.0 on
  - getCells now return cells which are not holes
  + getID(layer)
  + getPoints/Polygons/Lines/Cells(layer, slice) to read large datasets
  + GPM implementation now within aRT (under development)
  + new vignettes for fill cell and GPM

VERSION 1.7-4
  . now working with terralib 3.6.0

VERSION 1.7-3
  . now working with terralib 3.5_dev
  - bug in the functions for importing shapefiles
  - corrections to work with sp_0.9-66

VERSION 1.7-2
  . now working with terralib 3.4.0
  + now working with PostGIS
  + openConn() now tries to load [default] options in .aRTrc
    whenever called without arguments.
  - bug in createColumn within 64 bits
  - Every column name to be stored in the database
    will be converted to its lowercase due to Postgre,
    which only works with lowercases.

VERSION 1.7-1
  - minor bug in SpatialPoints[DF]
  + now compiling in Linux 64
  + NAMESPACE
  - getClip can return now more than one polygon
  - aRT is R CMD checked again!
  * due to the corrections for rcmdchecking, some parameters have 
    changed their names, therefore THERE IS NO BACK COMPATIBILITY.
    Fortunately, these parameters are usually called as unamed. For
    instance, aRT/test scripts did not changed.

VERSION 1.7-0
  * no more confusion between 'id' and 'ID': old objects and functions
    that used 'id' now use 'ID' (NO BACK COMPATIBILITY)
  * aRTplot() was removed. plot does everything and much more.
  + all scripts and vignettes revised due to these changes
  - removing conflicts with pkg 'nlme' on getData (now internal calls
    to this function use aRT::getData)
  . print(aRTconn) now shows the available databases
  . addRaster() now accepts a SpatialPixelsDataFrame
  + a coupple of new informative error messages

VERSION 1.6-4
  + getPixels now cutting also from polygons
  + new strategy for filling cellular spaces (weighbra)
  + inst/CITATION
  . some corrections in man/*

VERSION 1.6-3 (nomination)
  . now working with terralib 3.3.0
  . now working with R 2.9.1
  - now working correctly with polygons that contain holes
  - slicing cells and points correctly in setVisual(aRTtheme)
  + getClip(aRTgeometry) clips polygons/lines given a set of polygons
  + new argument 'calcal' to getGeometry(aRTgeometry)
  + getCells(aRTlayer)
  + aRTinstallreport()

VERSION 1.6-2
  . now working with terralib 3.2.1
  . now working with R 2.8.0
  - now hiding password in print(aRTconn)
  - getSetOperation(layer, "union") bug fixed
  - bugs on importSpData (when using points and/or views)
  + getRelation with more than one operation at once

VERSION 1.6-1
  * filling cellular spaces according to the cell plugin
  * reading cellular spaces from databases

VERSION 1.6-0 (trip to Parana)
  * Now working with R 2.7.2
  * Now working with Windows again (finally!)
  - scripts revised
  - documentation revised

VERSION 1.5-0
  * Now working with terralib 3.2.0 and R 2.6.2
  + .aRTrc available for connections
  - minor bug when creating a new column
  - minor bug in the error when trying to update the database version

VERSION 1.4-0
  * Now working with terralib 3.2 RC1 and R 2.5
  * aRT now needs TerraLib as well as TerraView for compiling

VERSION 1.3-3
  * addUser() has been removed, and we have implemented three
    functions for working with permissions
  + addPermission()
  + getPermissions()
  + dropUser()

VERSION 1.3-2
  + aRT now supports compiling with SQLite

VERSION 1.3-1
  - problems with temporal tables

VERSION 1.3-0
  + GPM (Generalized Proximity Matrix) algorithms
  + new classes 'aRTnetwork' and 'aRTgpm'
  + one user can load to read and write the view set of another user 
    when she opens the database openDb(con, "db", views="user")
  + read cells from the database as SpatialPolygons
  - getData(theme) wrongly returned only the first element

VERSION 1.2-1
  + aRT now supports Postgre DBMS version 8.1
  + vignettes updated
  + new argument to createDb(): 'delete'
  + getData(table) returns NA for empty values

VERSION 1.2-0
  * working with R 2.4-0 and sp 0.9-1 (NO BACK COMPATIBILITY)
    (@data in SpatialPointsDataFrame is no longer AttributeList)
  - bug with projection in importSpData()

VERSION 1.1-0
  + cell algorithms using vectorial data without attributes in
    createAndFillColumns()
  + deleteTheme() and deleteView() from a database
  + openTheme() directly from the database (instead of using a layer)

VERSION 1.0-5
  + compatibility with g++ 4.1.2
  + importMif(db,...) to import MID/MIF files
  + new arguments to addUser(): 'remote', 'host' and 'pass'
  - bug that generated error at the end of deleteView(), 
    deleteLayer(), createAndFillCell(), openDb(..., update=T),
    and probably others
  + reload(db) to reload the layers and themes informations
    (when the database is changed outside R)

VERSION 1.0-4
  + Creating layers of cells from layers of polygons: createLayer()
  + Strategies for populating static tables of cells: createAndFillColumn()
  - view now has the same projection of its oldest layer
    in the older version it was always 'noprojection'
  + openTable(l) returns the first table (useful when it has only one table)

VERSION 1.0-3
  * aRT working with TerraLib 3.1.3 (NO back compatibility)
  + aRTlayer recognizes cells

VERSION 1.0-2
  * new class 'aRTraster' (keeping back compatibility)
  + getPixels(): relation between raster and points
  + TerraLib version in aRTversion()
  + Some examples updated

VERSION 1.0-1
  * TerraLib with MySQL 5.0
  + support to new TerraLib functionality of PROJ.4 strings
